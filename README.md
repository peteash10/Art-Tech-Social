# Art and Tech Social: Experimental Capture
*with Pete Ashton at BOM, Jan 10th 2017*

These notes will be updated during and after the workshop with things that come up in discussions, so check back later!

## Introductory Things

My name is [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com) and you can see my art at [art.peteashton.com](http://art.peteashton.com). I'm [@peteashton](http://twitter.com/peteashton) on Twitter. 

We're at [Birmingham Open Media](http://www.bom.org.uk), aka BOM, which is [@bomlab](http://twitter.com/bomlab) on Twitter.

This workshop is based on [Golan Levin](http://www.flong.com)'s course of the same name from Carnegie Mellon and he's put [all the course materials online](http://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture), which is delightful of him. I'll link to specific pages below but please do have an explore as there's loads of good stuff in there. 

[James George's talk at EYEO 2015](https://vimeo.com/134973504) is a good "Experimental Capture 101".

## Photogrammetry

The best tool for this is [Photoscan](http://www.agisoft.com). You can run it in demo mode for free (no saving or exporting) or request a 30 day free trial. After that it's not cheap but not too expensive. 

[A guide to using Photoscan.](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/workshop/pdf/photogrammetry_from_video_with_photoscan.pdf)

[An overview of Photogrammetry](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/docs/Photogrammetry-and-3D-scanning.md)

[Shining 360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AupAFblRwgY) - a 3D video made from putting long tracking shots from The Shining through PhotoScan. (Needs Chrome)

## Depth

[Open Kinect for Processing](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing) - this will let you access Kinect data through Processing on any computer. 

[Clouds](http://www.cloudsdocumentary.com/) - a documentary made with a Kinect mounted under a DSLR capturing RGB Video and Depth.
